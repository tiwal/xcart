Additional "templates" window will appear with the list of all included templates. You can call the template editor from it by clicking on a template. Notice that the browser status line (at the bottom) changes when you move the mouse over the site. Depending on the position of your mouse it indicates (a) the template name and (b) the label name. To change the label, click on it. If the label is under a hyperlink, move your mouse over it (its name appears at the bottom) and press "e" (Edit) on the keyboard. Label dialog will appear. You can (1) preview the site after setting the label, (2) save the text into the database, and (3) copy the label name into the clipboard (IE only).<br /><br />More tips:<ol><li>The language variables must be set in the language that is selected for your site as current;</li><li>Close any template windows &amp; label windows before entering Webmaster mode again;</li><li>To quit Webmaster mode, go to admin zone, click on "Close Webmaster mode";</li><li>Webmaster mode is based on sessions: it applies only to the computer it has been set up on.
