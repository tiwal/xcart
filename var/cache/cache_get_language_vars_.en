<ul>
<li>Individual prices are arranged in the order of increasing the quantity of items for which the price is defined and decreasing the price amount (For example, 10+ items - $5 per item, 20+ items - $4 per item, 30+ items - $3 per item).</li>
<li>The prices are filtered by customer membership: customers without a membership see only the prices available to "All"; customers with a specific membership see both the prices available to "All" and to their membership.</li>
<li>The final filtering that defines which prices need to be displayed to a specific customer is performed according to the principle of the lowest price: at each level of wholesale pricing, customers are shown only the lowest price available to them.</li>
</ul>
For example, if in the store's administration back-end the prices are defined like this:
<pre>
Base price - $6 per item - Membership: All,
10+ items - $5 per item - Membership: All,
20+ items - $3 per item - Membership: Premium,
30+ items - $4 per item - Membership: All,
40+ items - $2.5 per item - Membership: Premium,
100+ items - $2 per item - Membership: Wholesale</pre>
, in the Customer area, a customer with Premium membership will be shown just the following prices:
<pre>
Base price - $6 per item - Membership: All,
10+ items - $5 per item - Membership: All,
20+ items - $3 per item - Membership: Premium,
40+ items - $2.5 per item - Membership: Premium</pre>
The price "100+ items - $2 per item - Membership: Wholesale" will be excluded from the list as unavailable to the Premium membership. <br />
The price "30+ items - $4 per item - Membership: All" will be excluded as fully replaceable by the price "20+ items - $3 per item - Membership: Premium" being the lowest price available to Premium members buying any number of items from the quantity range of 20-40 items.";s:30:"lbl_wholesale_admin_note_small";s:234:"When defining wholesale prices, please be aware that the list of prices that is displayed to a customer in the Customer area is sorted and filtered in a special way so that a customer can see only the prices actually available to him.";s:20:"lbl_wholesale_prices";s:16:"Wholesale prices";s:30:"lbl_wholesale_prices_checking_";s:28:"Checking wholesale prices...";s:31:"lbl_wholesale_prices_exporting_";s:29:"Exporting wholesale prices...";s:31:"lbl_wholesale_prices_importing_";s:29:"Importing wholesale prices...";s:9:"lbl_width";s:5:"Width";s:13:"lbl_wish_list";s:9:"Wish list";s:14:"lbl_wish_lists";s:10:"Wish lists";s:24:"lbl_with_comma_delimiter";s:22:"(with comma delimiter)";s:28:"lbl_with_semicolon_delimiter";s:26:"(with semicolon delimiter)";s:22:"lbl_with_tab_delimiter";s:20:"(with tab delimiter)";s:12:"lbl_wl_clear";s:15:"Clear wish list";s:12:"lbl_wl_empty";s:23:"Your wish list is empty";s:21:"lbl_word_verification";s:18:"Image verification";s:23:"lbl_worldpay_md5_secret";s:27:"MD5 secret for transactions";s:23:"lbl_worldpay_return_url";s:10:"Return URL";s:20:"lbl_wrong_db_version";s:29:"WRONG X-CART DATABASE VERSION";s:17:"lbl_wrong_formula";s:21:"Wrong formula format!";s:16:"lbl_wrong_status";s:12:"Wrong status";s:20:"lbl_wrong_url_format";s:43:"The format of the specified URL is invalid.";s:17:"lbl_xaff_relation";s:17:"Commission source";s:27:"lbl_xcart_debugging_console";s:17:"Debugging Console";s:14:"lbl_xcart_faqs";s:11:"X-Cart FAQs";s:17:"lbl_xcart_manuals";s:14:"X-Cart manuals";s:29:"lbl_xpc_api_version_supported";s:40:"API {{api_version}} version is supported";s:12:"lbl_xpc_auth";s:4:"Auth";s:15:"lbl_xpc_capture";s:7:"Capture";s:26:"lbl_xpc_config_description";s:156:"The values of Store ID, Public key, Private key and Private key password fields should be copied from this online store details page in X-Payments back-end.";s:14:"lbl_xpc_deploy";s:6:"Deploy";s:35:"lbl_xpc_deploy_configuration_module";s:36:"Use X-Payments configuration bundle:";s:21:"lbl_xpc_do_not_change";s:13:"Do not change";s:26:"lbl_xpc_go_to_payment_page";s:29:"Go to X-Payments payment page";s:30:"lbl_xpc_import_payment_methods";s:22:"Import payment methods";s:13:"lbl_xpc_pm_id";s:27:"X-Payments configuration ID";s:23:"lbl_xpc_recommendations";s:35:"Failed to meet PCI-DSS requirements";s:28:"lbl_xpc_recommend_disable_cc";s:192:"Option "Do not ask customers to enter CC information while getting registered" is disabled.

Unlike a big store in which a visitor can get lost, a landing page keeps the visitor's attention focused, so he knows what he is looking for when he decides to visit the store via a link on the landing page.<br />If the sites advertising your store in the framework of one campaign are going to use a landing page where a visitor will get before going to your store, you can enable the system to identify this campaign by the landing page it uses for advertising your store.<br />Please enter the URL of the landing page from which the customer will get to your store into the field below.

If, while making alterations to your database tables, you fail to consistently change all the related data (for example, if you add a new product, but fail to add a price for that product), MySQL will not be able to join the respective tables and perform the selection of data from them properly.

<p>Pages of X-Cart based stores are generated dynamically, which means, their URLs are also dynamic: each page URL is formed from a query to the store's database and contains a query string. For example, a typical product page URL looks like the following: http://www.example.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16133</p>

<p>Dynamic URLs containing query strings pose a problem for SEO, because they stop many search engines from indexing the pages in which they are used. They are also hard to read.</p>

<p>X-Cart provides a functionality that allows you to solve the problem of dynamic URLs: the so-called "clean" URLs. "Clean" URLs are custom SEO-friendly URLs that are used instead of the original dynamic ones. For a product page, a "clean" URL could look like this: http://www.example.com/xcart/Product-Name.html</p>

<p>At present, X-Cart's Clean URLs functionality works only for Apache web servers with the module mod_rewrite enabled. By default, this functionality is disabled in X-Cart. If your store's site is powered by Apache web server that has the Apache mod_rewrite module configured and enabled, you can enable usage of clean URLs in your store as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Edit the file <code>{{htaccess}}</code> to insert the following lines:<br />
<pre style="width:600px; overflow: auto; border: 1px solid #CCC">{{clean_url_htaccess}}</pre><br />
Warning: In rare cases, because of the specific configuration of your server, inserting the above lines into your .htaccess file may render your store site inaccessible to users. For this reason, we recommend that before editing .htaccess you make a backup copy of the original .htaccess file so it can be restored if anything goes wrong. We also recommend you experiment with your .htaccess file at the time of least activity on your store site, or close the store for visitors before you make any changes to .htaccess.

<p>After inserting the above lines into your .htaccess file, try to open X-Cart's home page (preferably, in a new browser window, so you can keep this instruction page open). If you do not see any error messages returned by the server, all is well, and you can proceed to the next step. If you see error messages, restore the original .htaccess file from backup and contact your hosting provider about the problems you are having with the functionality of Apache's mod_rewrite module (Send them the lines you have tried to insert into your .htaccess file).</p>
</li>

<li>Run a basic test to see whether the Clean URLs functionality can work at your store:<br />
Open the <a href="{{clean_url_test_url}}">{{clean_url_test_url}}</a> page in your browser. Requesting this page will launch an automated test of the Clean URLs functionality. When the page opens, you should see an only message:<br />
<br />
<code><strong>"Clean URLs system test completed successfully."</strong></code><br />
<br />
If you see this message, it means that the test has been completed successfully, and you can proceed to the next step. If, instead of the above message, you see any error messages, contact X-Cart's support team for assistance.
</li>

<li>Enable the option "Enable Clean URLs" in the Clean URL options section on this page.<br />
After you apply the settings, the Clean URLs functionality in your store will be enabled. From this moment, X-Cart will be able to use search engine friendly URLs for your product, category, manufacturer and static pages.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that X-Cart automatically generates clean URLs for all the pages of the above named types in your store, regardless of whether the Clean URLs functionality is enabled or not. You can see these automatically generated clean URLs in the details of the respective products, categories, manufacturers and static pages (See the 'Clean URL' field). When you enable the option "Enable Clean URLs", the clean URLs generated by X-Cart become the actual clean URLs for the respective pages. If you wish to use clean URLs different from the ones generated by X-Cart, you can edit the contents of the 'Clean URL' field on the Details pages of your products, categories, manufacturers and static pages to provide the desired values. The 'Clean URL' field becomes editable after the Clean URLs functionality is enabled.</p><p>When your store's database is upgraded from 4.1 to 4.2, or changes are made to the data in your store's database tables directly (not through X-Cart's user interface), pages without clean URLs may appear in your store.

Relationships between affiliates are described in terms of levels. Affiliate supports four levels at which affiliates can earn commissions for sales referred by their "descendants":<br /><br />Level 1: "parent-child" relationship<br />Level 2: "grandparent-grandchild" relationship<br />Level 3: "great grandparent-great grandchild" relationship<br />Level 4: "great great grandparent-great great grandchild" relationship<br /><br />You need to define commission rates for each level of your affiliate program.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Suppose, Jack, Jill and Jane are members of your affiliate program.<br />Historically, Jack referred Jill, and Jill referred Jane.<br />The affiliate scheme used by your store is multi-tier and has three levels. The commission rates for these levels are adjusted as follows:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1: 25%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2: 10%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3: 5%<br />In the affiliate scheme "Jack -> Jill -> Jane", the relationships of Jack to Jill and of Jill to Jane correspond to Level 1 (parent-child), and the relationship of Jack to Jane - to Level 2 (grandparent-grandchild). Level 3 is not used.<br />A customer comes to your store site through Jane's link and purchases products for $100 (The discounted subtotal of his order is $100).<br />Jane uses an affiliate plan that does not provide any commission rates on specific products or categories - just a basic commission rate of 1%.<br />The affiliate commission amounts that you will be supposed to pay to the members of your affiliate program for the sale referred by Jane are the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane: $1 (1% of the discounted order subtotal, calculated based on the basic commission rate according to Jane's affiliate plan)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jill: $0.25 (25% of Jane's commission, calculated according to Level 1)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack: $0.1(10% of Jane's commission, calculated according to Level 2)";s:28:"txt_partner_accounts_comment";s:135:"<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Payable accounts are the accounts for which the approved commission exceeds the minimum commission payment.";s:25:"txt_partner_accounts_note";s:291:"This section provides information about partner accounts.
