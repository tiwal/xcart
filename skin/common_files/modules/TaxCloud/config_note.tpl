<p><b>TaxCloud Registration</b></p>

<p>In order to take advantage of this X-Cart plug-in, you must first <a href="http://s.x-cart.com/taxcloud" target="__new"><b>register with TaxCloud</b></a>.</p>

<p>When you register with TaxCloud you will have the opportunity to specify sales tax collection details.</p>

<p><b>API ID &amp; API Key</b></p>

<p>As part of the TaxCloud registration process you will be asked to enter the URL of your web store(s). This is done on the "Locations" page. When you enter a website, a window will open from the bottom of the page. That window will include the API ID and API Key. That information needs to be noted and entered as part of your X-Cart/TaxCloud Settings.</p>

<p><b>TICs</b></p>

<p>You may also enter a default TIC for your TaxCloud setting. A TIC (Taxability Information Code) is used to classify your merchandise for purposes of taxation. If ALL of your merchandise fits into a single category based on <a href="http://taxcloud.net/tic/" target="__new">this table</a>, then you should enter that code at TaxCloud and on the X-Cart Setting. TaxCloud uses this default value only if your tax lookup request does not include a valid TIC.</p>

<p>It is also important that you update your catalogue of merchandise so that each item is assigned the proper TIC. TIC help TaxCloud determine if an item of merchandise is exempt from taxation or has a special rate. For example, in some states Clothing (TIC 20010) is exempt from sales tax. This is also true of Shipping charges (TIC 11010). <a href="http://taxcloud.net/tic/" target="__new">Use this table to determine the proper TIC.</a></p>

<p><b>USPS ID</b></p>

<p>TaxCloud will routinely verify your "ship to" address. This is partly done to ensure that TaxCloud uses the correct taxing jurisdiction for your sale. If you have a USPS ID, enter it in the X-Cart/TaxCloud registration below. If you do not have a USPS ID, you may obtain one by going to <a href="http://www.usps.com/shippingassistant" target="__new">http://www.usps.com/shippingassistant</a>.</p>

<p>After the USPS Shipping Assistant has been downloaded, installed and registered, the UserID can be found in the "About" box. It is in parentheses to the right of the name of the registered user.</p>

<p><b>Exercising the APIs</b></p>

<p>Before your web store can go live with TaxCloud you will have to complete a test order. This will allow us to confirm that your settings are correct. After you have done this there will be a "go live" button available for your website in TaxCloud. Once you click this button all of your transactions will be recorded as live transactions in the TaxCloud system.</p>

<p><b>Monthly Tax Reports and Filings</b></p>

<p>TaxCloud makes a series of reports available to you at the close of each month. You will find these reports in the "Transactions" and the "Filings" tabs of your TaxCloud account. You can also download your monthly detailed data in CSV format (look for the Download button in the Transactions tab).</p>

<p>TaxCloud can even file your state sales tax returns for you. For more information on this consult the TaxCloud site.</p>
